README FIRST:

The application can be launched from src.GUI.DBGui.java

When the initial screen opens, there will be a "Login" button to the top right.  Click this to enter the same command-line prompts as from Mod5.  
!!!NOTE:  The currently stored login arguments are specific to my machine, so you'll have to use your own arguments for your version!!!

Clicking on any of the table names will bring up a query page.
Clicking "Search" with an empty block is the same as "Select * from ...", and will display the entire table.

Right now the search field is only set up to search for the values in column 1.

Things that don't work yet:
-Query Builder
-Add/delete
-For some reason column headers are blacked out
